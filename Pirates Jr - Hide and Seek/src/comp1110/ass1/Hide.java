/**
 * This class represents a game of 'hide', which is based directly on a children's game
 * from 'SmartGames' called "Pirates Jr -- Hide and seek"
 *
 *    http://www.smartgames.eu/en/smartgames/pirates-jr-â€“-hide-seek
 *
 * The class and the those that it refer to provide the core logic of
 * the game, which is used by the GUI, which runs the game in a window.
 *
 *
 * The game uses the following encodings to represent game state.
 *
 * The board is represented by a string of 36 characters (3x3x4 = 36),
 * each character is either a '.' (meaning that the corresponding square
 * is unoccupied or masked), or by a letter from 'A' to 'H' corresponding
 * to one of the eight animals.   The board is fixed.  It never changes.
 *
 * The 36 board positions are indexed starting with the nine positions
 * in the top-left quadrant, then those in the top-right, then the
 * bottom-left, then finally the bottom-right.   Within each quadrant, the
 * pieces are numbered consecutively starting at top left, continuing
 * across the first row, then to the second row, finishing with the bottom
 * right square in the quadrant.   Thus:
 *   -  0 indexes the top-left square in the game
 *   - 11 indexes the top-right square in the game
 *   - 24 indexes the bottom-left square in the game
 *   - 35 indexes the bottom-right square in the game
 *   - etc.
 *
 * The four masks are represented by the four letters 'W', 'X', 'Y', and 'Z'.
 *
 * The images of the eight shapes and four masks can be seen in the
 * gui/assets folder.
 *
 * The state of the masks (where each one is placed, and with what orientation)
 * is represented by a string of four characters.   Each character is either
 * a space ' ', indicating that that mask has not been placed, or is a
 * letter from 'A' to 'P' which encodes where that mask has been placed, and at
 * what orientation (two of the masks, 'Y' and 'Z', have only two orientations, since
 * the other two orientations are are simple reflections).  These encodings
 * are described in detail in the Mask class.
